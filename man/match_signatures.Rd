\title{Find the best matches between two sets of signatures}
\usage{
match_signatures(sigs_a, sigs_b)
}
\arguments{
\item{sigs_a}{Signatures estimate; either a list such as one produced by 
\code{\link{retrieve_pars}}, with a \code{$mean} entry, or a numeric matrix with one 
row per signature and one column for each of the 96 mutation types.}

\item{sigs_b}{Signatures estimate as for \code{sigs_a}.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing, for each signature in \code{sigs_a}, the index 
of the closest match in \code{sigs_b}.
}
\description{
\code{match_signatures} compares two independent estimates of signatures to 
find the closest matches between them.
