\description{
A data set of 67 SBS signatures from COSMIC v3.0 (May 2019).
These signatures were extracted using SigProfiler (as described in Alexandrov
et al., 2020) from the 2,780 whole-genome variant calls produced by the
ICGC/TCGA Pan Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Network.
The following signatures are annotated as "Possible sequencing artefacts":
SBS27, SBS43, SBS45-60.
