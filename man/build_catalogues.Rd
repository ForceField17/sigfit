\title{Builds mutational catalogues from a table containing the base change and
trinucleotide context of each single-nucleotide variant in every sample.}
\usage{
build_catalogues(variants)
}
\arguments{
\item{variants}{Matrix with one row per single-nucleotide variant, and four columns:
Sample ID (character, e.g. "Sample 1"); REF base (character: "A", "C", "G", or "T"); ALT 
base (character: "A", "C", "G", or "T"); and trinucleotide context of the variant (reference 
sequence between the positions immediately before and after the variant, e.g. "TCA").}
