\description{
A data set of 11 DBS signatures from COSMIC v3.2 (March 2021).
With a few exceptions, these signatures were extracted
using SigProfiler (as described in Alexandrov et al., 2020) from the 2,780
whole-genome variant calls produced by the ICGC/TCGA Pan Cancer Analysis of
Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Network.
