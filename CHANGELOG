CHANGE LOG

2021/10/22
Major changes in sigfit v2.2 ("G... G...")

* New COSMIC v3.2 signatures for indels and doublet base substitutions (18/11 signatures).
* Support for plotting mutational spectra of indels and doublet base substitutions.
* Added argument `generic` to plotting functions, for forcing use of 'generic' spectra.
* Extended package vignette.


2021/05/25
Major changes in sigfit v2.1 ("Focal Fragmentation")

* New COSMIC v3.2 signatures (78 SBS signatures).
* Fixed bug in `convert_signatures` function, which made it misbehave when mutational
  opportunities were given as a vector instead of a matrix. The function now expects
  opportunities to be provided as a vector.
* Exported functions `cosine_sim` and `l2_norm` (to calculate cosine similarity and
  L2 distance between vectors) so that they can be called by the user.


2019/11/08
Major changes in sigfit v2.0 ("Exogenous Exposure")

* New models for analysis of real-valued data ("normal") and robust fitting to sparse data ("negbin").
* New COSMIC v3 signatures (67 SBS signatures) and test datasets.
* Straightforward analysis and plotting of signatures defined over arbitrary mutation types.
* Support for mutational opportunities in all signature models.
* Support for signature and exposure priors in all signature models.
* Enhanced plotting functionalities.
* Increased MCMC sampling efficiency.
* Extended package vignette.


2019/03/29
Major changes in sigfit v1.3.1 ("Deleterious Dimer")

* Set up continuous integration with TravisCI (config file .travis.yml).
* Removed ggplot2 dependency.


2019/03/26
Major changes in sigfit v1.3.0 ("Deleterious Deletion")

* Fixed bug in `build_catalogues` function, which made it fail for single-sample cases.
* Implemented plotting routines for non-standard catalogues with arbitrary mutation categories.
* Catalogues with non-integer mutation counts are automatically rounded with a warning
  (current models admit only discrete counts).
* Added alternative specifications of transcriptional strand in the input mutation matrix: 
  1 or "1" or "U" for untranscribed strand; -1 or "-1" or "T" for transcribed strand.
* Included additional arguments to `plot_all`, `plot_exposures` and `plot_reconstructions`
  for further plot customisation.
* Added citation information.


2018/07/14
Major changes in sigfit v1.2.0 ("Clock-like Component")

* Argument `method` has been renamed `model` in all relevant functions.
* Implemented data frame compatibility, so that input objects to functions chan be either 
  matrices or data frames.
* Tables within the list returned by function `retrieve_pars` are now data frames.
* New vignette section on how to convert between genome- and exome-relative 
  representations of signatures.


2018/04/28
Major changes in sigfit v1.1.0 ("BRCA Breakdown")

 * Objects returned by `sigfit::fit_signatures`, `sigfit::extract_signatures` and
   `sigfit::fit_extract_signatures` are now lists containing both input data and output results.
 * Argument `signature_names` has been removed in function `sigfit::retrieve_pars`.
 * Arguments `counts` and `signature_names` have been removed in function `sigfit::plot_exposures`.
 * Arguments `counts` and `signatures` have been removed in function `sigfit::plot_reconstruction`.
 * Arguments `counts` and `signatures` have been removed in function `sigfit::plot_all`.
 * Argument `feature` has been renamed to `par` in `sigfit::retrieve_pars`.
